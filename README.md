A very simple image library frame made with plain html, css and javaScript hosted on Flask
Supported formats: **.png, .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .bmp, .webp, .mkv, .mp4**
Although displaying video formats doesn't work for now, also the searching doesn't work yet
I have plans to eventually fix those issue and add support for tagging pictures

Sooo... you obviously need **flask** (python library) to run it,
once you have flask you just lunch server.py and thats it
*tested on python 3.12.2*

any promlems/questions welcome anywhere :3
