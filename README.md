A very simple image library frame made with plain html, css and javaScript hosted on Flask.
Supported formats: **.png, .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .bmp, .webp, .webm, .mp4**.
Although displaying video formats doesn't (fully) work for now but you can add them if you want,
also the search doesn't work yet.
I have plans to eventually fix those issue and add support for tagging pictures and more

Sooo... you obviously need **flask** (python library) to run it,
once you have flask you just lunch server.py and thats it
*tested on python 3.12.2*
